**What types of projects are supportable?**  
Projects can include, but are not limited to:
Projects initiated by the community to improve the environment or advance environmental sustainability within the town (e.g. residents working together to set up a community fridge and redistribute excess food)
Educating the community and/or promoting awareness on methods and practices that improve the environment or advance environmental sustainability (e.g. organising workshops or campaigns to increase awareness and action on reducing single-use disposables)
Implementation of innovative technologies to help the community reduce usage of resources (e.g. installation of digital displays at the block to provide residents with real-time updates of energy and water usage)
Developing behavioural nudges and interventions to encourage environmentally-friendly habits (e.g. designing new recycling bins and signage to nudge residents to recycle right)


**Can my project receive other sources of funding in addition to the SG Eco Fund?**  
You are not allowed to apply for funding from more than one government grant scheme. However, you can still seek funding from other non-government sources. You will be required to submit a declaration on your funding sources in the application form.


**How long would it take for the application to be approved?**  
Assessment will take between 2 and 4 months, after the closure of the grant call. The actual time taken depends on the nature of the project, the completeness of the information submitted, and the grant quantum. 


**Can I submit more than one application for the SG Eco Fund?**  
You may submit more than one project application, but please provide information to show that you have enough manpower and resources to manage multiple projects.


**How will the grant be disbursed?**  
Grants are disbursed on a reimbursement basis after achieving agreed milestones and deliverables. Project milestones and deliverables will be set and agreed by both applicant and the SG Eco Office before the commencement of the project. 

Upon achieving agreed milestones and deliverables, the applicant should submit these documents: 
* Request for Reimbursement Form
* Project Milestone Report
* Original/certified true copies of receipts for projects with approved funding quantum of S$30,000 or below. For projects with approved funding quantum of more than S$30,000, applicants will have to engage an auditor and submit audited Statement of Accounts.
* Any other supporting documents

The claim for the final reimbursement should be submitted within 3 months of the project completion date. If the applicant requires some upfront funding after approval of the application, please write in to the SG Eco Office and provide reasons for the request.


**How should the receipts be submitted?**  
All receipts should be clearly labelled and arranged in accordance with the Statement of Accounts. For receipts which are not original, the organisation must certify them as true copies before submission. As receipts printed on thermal paper (e.g. supermarket receipt) will fade over time, please make a copy of the receipt for submission. We reserve the right to exclude receipts that are unclear or faded from the total project cost.


**Do I need to submit audited Statement of Accounts?**  
For projects with approved quantum exceeding S$30,000, applicants will have to engage an auditor and submit the audited Statement of Accounts. The cost of engaging the auditor should be included in the project budget during application.
 
 
 
 
 
 
**How do applicants amend their application or provide additional information?**  
Once a grant application is submitted, applicants will no longer be able to make any amendments. For amendment of critical fields such as project dates and budget amount, applicants may contact the SG Eco Office to put forth the request. It will be considered on a case-by-case basis.


**Who owns the Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) arising from the project?**  
Both the applicant and the SG Eco Fund will have co-ownership of the IPRs. The SG Eco Fund retains the rights to utilise IPRs for charitable purposes.
