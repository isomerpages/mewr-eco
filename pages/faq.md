**What types of projects are supportable?**  
Projects include, but are not limited to:
* Those jointly initiated by the community to improve the environment or advance environmental sustainability within the town (e.g. residents working together to set up a community fridge and redistribute excess food);
* Those educating the community and promoting awareness on environmental sustainability practices;
* Those implementing innovative technologies to help the community reduce usage of resources;
* Those developing behavioural nudges and interventions to encourage environmentally-friendly habits.



**Can projects receive other sources of funding in addition to the SG Eco Fund?**  
Applicants are not allowed to apply for funding from more than one government grant scheme. However, applicants can still seek funding from other non-government sources. Applicants will be required to submit a declaration on their funding sources in the application form.

**How long would it take for the application to be approved?**  
Evaluation of projects could take between two and four months, after the closure of the grant call. The actual time taken depends on the nature of the project, the completeness of the information submitted, and the grant quantum.

**Can I submit more than one application for the SG Eco Fund?**  
Applicants may submit more than one project application, but will have to show that they have enough manpower and resources to manage multiple projects.


**How will projects be assessed?**  

Projects will be evaluated against the following criteria:
* Track record and expertise
* Environmental sustainability
* Community engagement
* Implementation
* Innovation
* Impact


**How will the grant be disbursed?**  
Grants will be given out on a reimbursement basis, upon completing each project milestone. . The project milestones and deliverables will be set and agreed by both applicant and the SG Eco Office before the commencement of the project. 

Upon achieving agreed milestones and deliverables, the applicant should submit these documents: 
* Request for Reimbursement Form
* Project Milestone Report
* Original/certified true copies of receipts for projects with approved funding quantum of S$30,000 or below. For projects with approved funding quantum of more than S$30,000, applicants will have to engage an auditor and submit audited Statement of Accounts.
* Any other supporting documents

The claim for the final reimbursement should be submitted within three months of the project completion date. If the applicant requires some upfront funding after approval of the application, please write in to the SG Eco Office and provide reasons for the request.


**How should the receipts be submitted?**  
All receipts should be clearly labelled and arranged in accordance with the Statement of Accounts. For receipts which are not original, the organisation must certify them as true copies before submission. As receipts printed on thermal paper (e.g. supermarket receipt) will fade over time, please make a copy of the receipt for submission. We reserve the right to exclude receipts that are unclear or faded from the total project cost.


**Do applicants need to submit audited Statement of Accounts?**  
For projects with approved quantum exceeding S$30,000, applicants will have to engage an auditor and submit the audited Statement of Accounts. The cost of engaging the auditor should be included in the project budget during application.
 
 

**HHow do applicants amend their application or provide additional information?**  
Once a grant application is submitted, applicants will no longer be able to make any amendments. For amendment of critical fields such as project dates and budget amount, applicants may contact the SG Eco Office to put forth the request. It will be considered on a case-by-case basis.


**Who owns the Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) arising from the project?**  
Both the applicant and the SG Eco Fund will have co-ownership of the IPRs. The SG Eco Fund retains the rights to utilise IPRs for charitable purposes.
