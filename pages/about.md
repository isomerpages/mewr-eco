The $50 million SG Eco Fund was set up in 2020 to support projects that advance environmental sustainability and involve the community.

Since independence, Singapore has sought to balance economic growth with environmental sustainability and social inclusion. Climate change is a global challenge. Given Singaporeâ€™s constraints as a small and highly-urbanised city-state, we must leverage our strengths to enhance our climate resilience and transition to a Zero Waste Nation.

A sustainable and green Singapore can only be achieved with the people, private, and public sectors working in partnership to protect our environment and keep our public spaces clean, green and liveable. Through the SG Eco Fund, we hope to enable our community to build a sustainable Singapore for present and future generations.

**Our Vision**

Together, a sustainable and green Singapore for all generations.

**Our Mission**

To enable our community to build a sustainable and green Singapore.
